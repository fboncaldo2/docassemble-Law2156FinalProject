id: Divorce in Massachusetts
question: |
  Divorce in Massachusetts
subquestion: |
  There are two categories of divorce in Massachusetts: Fault and No-Fault. 
        
    In a Fault Divorce, the person asking for the divorce must prove a specific reason for the divorce. The Fault Divorce process can take longer and be more expensive than a No-Fault divorce. The specific reasons and grounds are listed in M.G.L. c. 208, § 1, and are listed as follows:
        
           - Adultery
           - Desertion
           - Gross and confirmed habits of intoxication
           - Cruel and abusive treatment
           - Non-support
           - Impotency
           - A prison sentence of 5 or more years
        
    No-Fault Divorces in Massachusetts are broken up into two types of divorce: 1A and 1B.
        
    You should file for a 1A divorce when both you and your spouse agree that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and can’t continue and you and your spouse have reached a written agreement about child support, parenting time, alimony, child custody & dividing marital assets.
        
    You should file for a 1B divorce when you or your spouse believes the marriage has ended or both spouses believe the marriage has ended, but you and your spouse aren't in agreement about custody, support, or marital property issues. This is called a Contested No-Fault Divorce.
        
    The three types of divorce require different procedures and the process of determining what type of divorce is needed for your marriage can be difficult to navigate without the help of a family law attorney. 
        
    This form does not require you to know or select what type of divorce you want to file, but instead will ask questions about the reasons you feel like your marriage should end. Your responses will give your family law attorney the information necessary to make the important decision as to what type of divorce is best for you.

id: Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage
question: |
  Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage
subquestion: |

  No-Fault Divorce Grounds
subquestion: |

But even if you did select one of the Fault Divorce grounds, please answer both of the following questions.
